Custom Designed Home Assisstant Energy Meter
This is a custom designed energy meter for Home Assistant Dashboard using the Picture Elements card.

Mainly it is a custom background on which you can load your own sensors, logos, links etc.
Also it has a simple animated gif to be more live in your dashboard.

Feel free to make any changes you wish in order to make it more useful to your needs.

Just place the images into your own folder of images in Home Assistant and paste my code to get started.

BEWARE
This is not a card that has anything ready to run.

You will nedd to have the following already preconfigured

1) Total Consumption Sensor
2) Monthly Consumption Sensor
3) Scraped prices from your supplier and title of month.
4) The nightly indicator is a toggle helper that turns on/off specific times of day and month with an automation.
   

Have Fun :)
