Custom Designed Home Assisstant Energy Meter
This is a custom designed energy meter for Home Assistant Dashboard using the Picture Elements card.

Mainly it is a custom background on which you can load your own sensors, logos, links etc.
Also it has a simple animated gif to be more live in your dashboard.

Feel free to make any changes you wish in order to make it more usefull to your needs.

Just place the images into your own folder of images in Home Assistant and paste my code to get started.

Have Fun :)
